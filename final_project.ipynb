    "# **AMAZON BUY BOX** \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different vendors that sell the same product for different prices on Amazon. However, there are only 3 different vendor types. The first vendor type is Amazon themselves. The second vendor type is called FBA; FBA vendors are 3rd party vendors that use Amazon's warehouse and fulfillment service to fullfill orders (they have to pay Amazon for this service). And the third vendor type is called Other; Other vendors are 3rd party vendors that list there products on Amazon but fulfill their own orders from their own facilities. Amazon's algorithm will order the product listings so that the listing with the lowest price will be ranked number one and appear first. In addition to this ranking system, Amazon has what is known as the \"buy box\". The buy box appears as the very first listing for a product, even before the number one ranked listing. The very first listing to appear for a product has a significantly higher percentage of selling than the rest. Amazon says that their algorithm takes more than just the price in to consideration when determining which listing will win the buy box. Some examples they give are lead time and stock availabilty, but they will not disclose everything because it is their own proprietary algorithm. This means that a listing with a higher price than the number one ranked listing can win the buy box. After some analysis of the data, it seems Amazon's buy box algorithm takes the vendor type heavily in to consideration. It seems Amazon's algorithm significantly favors its own listings, and listings from FBA vendors, over the Other vendors that do no use Amazon's FBA service. Since a 3rd party vendor has no option to become Amazon, my questions and comparisons will focus between FBA vendors and Other vendors."

    "#### We can assume that an FBA vendor has a higher chance to win the buy box over an Other vendor if the following are true:\n",
    "    - There are more instances where an FBA vendor wins the buy box when they are not ranked number 1 as compared to when an Other vendor wins the buy box when they are not ranked number 1.\n",

    "#### FBA vendors won the buy box for more product listings than they were ranked number 1 for. They have won the buy box for 83% of the product listings that they were ranked number 1 for. And 41% of the buy boxes they won were for product listings that they were not ranked number 1 for. \n",
    "#### Other vendors won the buy box for far fewer products than they were ranked number 1 for. They only won the buy box for 31% of the product listings that they were ranked number 1 for. And only 4% of the buy boxes they won were for product listings that they were not ranked number 1 for. \n",
    "#### Amazon gives FBA vendors a much higher chance to win the buy box over Other vendors.\n",
    "#### The hypothesis is confirmed that 3rd party vendors selling products on Amazon will have a higher chance to win the buy box for their product if they subscribe to the Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA) service.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I trained and fit a Logistic Regression Model and a Random Forest Model to predict the buy box vendor type based on the number 1 ranked (lowest priced) vendor type and also if an FBA vendor sells that same product. The dataset was very small (only 58 rows) so I made use of sampling to increase the dataset to 1000 rows. This improved our model's accuracy. Both the Logistic Regression Model and the Random Forest Model had the same accuracy score of 84% and the same confusion matrix results also. My guess is that the performance from both models were the same because we were predicting a binary classification based on only 2 different binary features. There were no features with multiple numeric values in numerical order, which would have required the use of regression and added a little more complexity to the math which would have perhaps made the two different models perform slightly differently."
